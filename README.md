# PostfixExpressionBuilder

An API for building, validate and evaluate associative binary operation expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (a.k.a. postfix notation).

- todo: 
    1) test for `_validate(infixChunk:)` internal function in order to make lighter tests for `_convertToRPN(infix:)` function.
    2) all missing test cases for API functions.
    3) eventually rename the package as `PostixExpressionsAPI`
    4) documentation.
    5) license.
    6) publish on github as public swift package.
