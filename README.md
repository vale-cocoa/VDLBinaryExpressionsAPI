# PostfixExpressionBuilder

An API for building, validate and evaluate associative binary operation expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (a.k.a. postfix notation).

- todo: 
    1) all missing test cases for API functions.
    2) eventually rename the package as `PostixExpressionsAPI`
    3) documentation.
    4) publish on github as public swift package.
